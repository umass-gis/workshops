# AGOL: The Basics
{: .no_toc }


## Overview
{:toc}
ArcGIS Online (https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) is an online mapping and analysis platform developed by Esri, a company specializing in geographic information systems (GIS). It allows users to create, share, and analyze maps and spatial data from anywhere with an internet connection.

AGOL is commonly used for:
* Mapping
* Spatial analysis
* Collaborating in groups and sharing with the public
* Apps for field data collection, story maps, and dashboards
* Integrating with other Esri products, like ArcGIS Pro

AGOL is accessible through a web browser and does not require installing software on your computer. Users can store their data and work with it on any machine through the AGOL cloud. Its analysis capabilities are less extensive than desktop software but still robust enough to do many kinds of spatial analysis.

## What is GIS
{:toc}
The “GIS” in ArcGIS stands for Geographic Information Systems (or Geographic Information Science, depending on who you ask). It’s a handy tool and/or approach for:
* Managing spatial data
* Analyzing patterns
* Creating maps

GIS is a rapidly growing field of study, fueled by ever-improving technology that allows users to analyze spatial patterns observed in our world. Many industries and professions benefit from having experienced GIS analysts on their team, including but not limited to utilities companies, conservation organizations, human rights groups and the public health sector, to name a few. Due to its remarkably wide range of applications, GIS skills are increasingly sought after in the job market. 

## Map layers
{:toc}
In GIS, each distinct dataset has its own layer. You can think of a web map as a layer cake, with each layer representing one aspect of the real world.

## Data types
{:toc}
There are two kinds of spatial data: rasters and vectors.

## Popular apps in AGOL
{:toc}
This workshop will focus on AGOL’s mapping capabilities, but it’s worth noting that AGOL also includes a range of other complementary web applications, the most common being StoryMaps and Survey123.

### StoryMaps
StoryMaps is an interactive presentation tool for telling a story in scrollable format. StoryMaps can feature text, media like photos and videos, and maps created in AGOL. For examples of how you can use StoryMaps with your work, check out the StoryMaps Gallery: https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-storymaps/gallery/

### Survey123
Survey123 is a tool that allows users to design their own surveys. Surveys can include text and multiple-choice questions, but they can also collect geographic data, unlike most other survey applications. The results can then be seamlessly displayed on a map in AGOL and used to create maps or other products. For examples of how you can use Survey123 with your work, check out the Survey123 Gallery: https://doc.arcgis.com/en/survey123/gallery/
