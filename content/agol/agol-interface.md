## Explore the AGOL Interface
{:toc}

After logging in, you will be taken to the homepage of your AGOL organization:

![AGOL Homepage](media/all_AGOL/Intro_03.jpg "AGOL Homepage")

The top bar has a range of menu options to explore:

| **Home** | Landing page, with quick links to content published by your organization (UMass Amherst) |
| **Gallery** | In-depth look at the content published by your organization |
| **Map** | Open AGOL’s Map Viewer, where you can add data to a map, customize the way it looks, edit your data, and run spatial analyses |
| **Scene** | Open AGOL’s Scene Viewer, where you can add and display data in 3D |
| **Notebook** | Place to create and view AGOL Notebooks, Esri’s version of Jupyter notebooks; Notebooks enable you to write Python code to assist with data management, repetitive tasks, and complex analysis |
| **Groups** | AGOL makes it possible to collaborate with groups of users within or outside your AGOL organization; a common use for this feature is to create groups for classes, where students can upload their projects and homeworks into a common shared cloud space |

Within the **Groups** blue menu bar, there are additional tabs you can click on:

  !['My Groups' page](media/all_AGOL/Intro_04.jpg)
 
  * **My groups** shows the groups that you are a member of. 
  * **Featured groups** shows the groups that Esri flagged for easy discovery; they contain Esri data that people may find useful, such as basemaps, aerial imagery, government-published data, and so on. 
  * **My organization’s groups** shows groups within the organization that that have have made their content publicly available to the organization.
* **Content:** this is where you can find all the content you’ve created or that you have access to. The blue menyu bar lets you navigate between different content types:
  * **My content** contains all the items you have created or added to your AGOL account. Items can be organized in folders using the interface in the top left corner.
  * **My favorites** shows any content you have starred as a favorite - essentially, this is a great way to bookmark items you see in AGOL that you want to be able to find quickly in the future.
  * **My groups** lists all the content shared with groups you are a member of.
  * **My organization** lists all the content shared with your organization.
  * **Living Atlas** is a curated selection of public content available on AGOL, which Esri’s team has flagged as special because of its exceptional documentation, authoritative status, or high view count. 
* **Organization:** shows your subscription ID, contact info for your organization’s administrator, and the organization’s members.
