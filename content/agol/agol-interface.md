## Explore the AGOL Interface
{:toc}

After logging in, you will be taken to the homepage of your AGOL organization:

<br>
### Top menu bar
{: .no_toc}

The top bar has a range of menu options to explore:

| **Home** | Landing page, with quick links to content published by your organization (UMass Amherst). |
| **Gallery** | In-depth look at the content published by your organization. |
| **Map** | Open AGOL’s Map Viewer, where you can add data to a map, customize the way it looks, edit your data, and run spatial analyses. |
| **Scene** | Open AGOL’s Scene Viewer, where you can add and display data in 3D. |
| **Notebook** | Place to create and view AGOL Notebooks, Esri’s version of Jupyter notebooks; Notebooks enable you to write Python code to assist with data management, repetitive tasks, and complex analysis. |
| **Groups** | AGOL makes it possible to collaborate with groups of users within or outside your AGOL organization; a common use for this feature is to create groups for classes, where students can upload their projects and homeworks into a common shared cloud space. |

### Groups
{: .no_toc}

Within the **Groups** blue menu bar, there are additional tabs you can click on:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>My groups</b></td>
      <td>Groups that you are a member of (for example, a class or lab group).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Featured groups</b></td>
      <td>Groups that Esri or your organization have flagged for easy discovery; they contain data that people may find useful, such as basemaps, aerial imagery, government-published data, and so on.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>My organization's groups</b></td>
      <td>Groups within the organization that aren't private and have made their data viewable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Content</b></td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li><b>My content</b> contains all the items you have created or added to your AGOL account. Items can be organized in folders using the interface in the top left corner.</li>
          <li><b>My favorites</b> shows any content you have starred as a favorite - essentially, this is a great way to bookmark items you see in AGOL that you want to be able to find quickly in the future.</li>
          <li><b>My groups</b> lists all the content shared with groups you are a member of.</li>
          <li><b>My organization</b> lists all the content shared with your organization.</li>
          <li><b>Living Atlas</b> is a curated selection of public content available on AGOL, which Esri’s team has flagged as special because of its exceptional documentation, authoritative status, or high view count.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Organization</b></td>
      <td>Shows your subscription ID, contact info for your organization’s administrator, and the organization’s members.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
