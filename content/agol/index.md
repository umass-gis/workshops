# Learn the Basics of ArcGIS Online

Learn the basics of ArcGIS Online (AGOL), Esri's cloud platform for working with GIS data in a web browser! In this workshop, you will learn how to:
* Navigate through the AGOL interface
* Find spatial data in AGOL and through external sources
* Make a web map and change how data looks
* Create your own data
* Analyze spatial data
* Share your work

This tutorial is current as of Spring 2025. AGOL is constantly updated, so you may find that your version of AGOL looks a bit different!
