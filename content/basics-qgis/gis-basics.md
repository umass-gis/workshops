## Overview
{:toc}

GIS stands for *Geographic Information Systems* (or *Geographic Information Science*, depending on who you ask). It's a handy tool and/or approach for:
* Managing spatial data
* Analyzing patterns
* Creating maps

Chances are, you've already interacted with a GIS application. Here are some examples:
* [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)
* [Mapping Ancient Athens](https://mappingancientathens.org/en/home/)
* [Connecticut Zoning Atlas](https://www.desegregatect.org/atlas)
* [Mapping Prejudice](https://mappingprejudice.umn.edu/racial-covenants/maps-data)

## Map layers
{:toc}

The examples of GIS applications have a lot of things in common:
* They all feature a map interface that allows you to zoom in/out and pan
* They all use the map to show some kind of data
* They display the data as layers overlaying a base image

In fact, thinking about GIS as a layer cake is one of the fun visuals that "intro to GIS" courses usually start with. In a way, GIS allows us to take the real world and turn it into a collection of abstract, spatial data layers.

## Data types
{:toc}

Let's dive into the data that makes up the layers in a GIS: **rasters** and **vectors**.
