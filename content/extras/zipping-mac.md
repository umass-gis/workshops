# Zipping Files in Mac

Zip files act like folders and may contain one or more compressed files. To access and use the files, the zip file must be “unzipped”. When creating a zip file, multiple files are combined into one .zip file, and the overall file size is reduced. Creating a ZIP file is helpful when you need to:
* Share more than one or two files with someone (over email, OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.)
* Reduce the total size of an email attachment
* Share a shapefile (since a shapefile is actually made up of multiple files)
* Backup a folder to save in OneDrive or Google Drive
