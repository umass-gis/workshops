## When to use an online tool
{:toc}

Online georeferencing tools are a great option if you:
* Aren't comfortable using desktop GIS software
* Want to quickly georeference an image
* Want to look at the georeferenced image online and don't plan to work with it further

Online tools require you to have only a basic knowledge of the georeferencing workflow to get started.
