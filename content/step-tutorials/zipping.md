Zip files act like folders and may contain one or more compressed files. To access and use the files, the zip file must be “unzipped”. When creating a zip file, multiple files are combined into one .zip file, and the overall file size is reduced. Creating a ZIP file is helpful when you need to:
* Share more than one or two files with someone (over email, OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.)
* Reduce the total size of an email attachment
* Share a shapefile (since a shapefile is actually made up of multiple files)
* Backup a folder to save in OneDrive or Google Drive
