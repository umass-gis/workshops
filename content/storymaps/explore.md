StoryMaps are a creative, web-based platform for telling stories. They are inherently interactive, allowing users to scroll, click, and explore different media elements. StoryMaps aren't just about maps... you can also include photos, videos, sound recordings, embedded websites and YouTube videos, etc.

Take a few minutes to explore some of these examples, paying attention to how the storytellers used different media to capture your attention:
