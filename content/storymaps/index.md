# Create a StoryMap

This is an evolving workshop that is designed to introduce you to storymapping. While there are several storymapping platforms out there, this one will focus on [Esri's ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/). By the end of the workshop, you will be able to:
* Create an engaging storymap outline
* Log into the ArcGIS Online platform
* Create a new storymap project
* Add text, media, and map content
* Publish and share your storymap
