**[The Basics of ArcGIS Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFYG9oEV1EE&t=720s)**
<br>Geoinformatics, 2018
<br>This video (~40 mins) introduces the basic processes and functions of ArcGIS Pro.

## Coordinate Reference Systems
**[Map Projections in ArcGIS Pro](https://youtu.be/2MKyts2e0Ww)**
<br>Jeff Sun, 2019
<br> This video (~15 mins) covers the basics of checking and manipulating projections within ArcGIS Pro.

*Specific topics:*
* [Check a layer’s projection (3:20)](https://youtu.be/2MKyts2e0Ww?t=199)
* [Check the map's projection (3:50)](https://youtu.be/2MKyts2e0Ww?t=230)
<br>This, in conjunction with the above process, can be used to verify that map and layers share the same projection.
* [Change the map projection to a specific UTM zone (4:27)](https://youtu.be/2MKyts2e0Ww?t=266)
<br>Note: the project-on-the-fly function doesn’t change the projection of the original data, just the way it is displayed in the map.
* [Use “Define Projection” to align data that has an “unknown projection” to your map (11:13)](https://youtu.be/2MKyts2e0Ww?t=673)
<br>Note: you will need to know the projection the data was originally created with in order to complete this process. Sometimes this information is available from the source (website, institution, person who sent you data, etc.).

## Designing a Map
**[Make a Layout in ArcGIS Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ9ei4-23MM)**
<br>ArcGIS, 2019
<br>This video (~ 4 mins) provides instruction on creating map layouts in ArcGIS Pro.

**[Make a Layout in ArcMap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Z8XXJj-fs)**
<br>Don Boyes, 2012
<br>This video (~5 mins) covers methods to adjust map layouts and page orientation in ArcMap.

**[How to Edit Your Legend in ArcMap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCc6y7cbPt8)**
<br>GIS with Dr. Russel, 2018
<br>This video (~13 mins) walks through the steps to create and edit legends in ArcMap.

## Manipulating Data

**[Georeferencing a Historical Air Photo in ArcGIS Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PORJevqTy4c)**
<br>Moulay Anwar Sounny-Slitine, 2018
<br>This video (~16 mins) walks through the steps to georeference historical maps and unreferenced raster layers.

**[Linking Tables Using Joins and Relates in ArcGIS Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuhCl-6vtOY)**
<br>eGIS Associates, 2020
<br>This video (~30 mins) introduces the reasons to perform table joins and relates, and it covers various methods to perform these functions.

*Specific topics:*
* [Different ways this function can be performed (1:33)](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=93)
* [Cardinality (2:54)](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=174)
<br>Defining primary and secondary datasets; determining how many features from one dataset match up with features from the other
* [Introduction to *joins* (6:16)](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=376)
* [Introduction to *relates* (10:30)](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=629)
* [Choose which fields to join (18:35)](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=1114)
* [Add a table join (21:20)](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=1280)
* [Add a table relate (24:43)](https://youtu.be/KuhCl-6vtOY?t=1483)
