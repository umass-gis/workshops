# Design a Web Map

Learn how to create a free, interactive web map using the open-source mapping software, QGIS. By the end of the workshop, you will be able to:
* Design a map in QGIS
* Use the qgis2web plugin to generate the web map files
* Deposit the files in a GitHub repo
* Publish the web map to a live URL

This workshop is geared toward folks with a basic understanding of GIS concepts. If you need help getting started with QGIS, check out the [Learn the Basics of QGIS](../basics-qgis) tutorial first. Previous experience with GitHub or with the HTML, JavaScript, or CSS languages is helpful, but not necessary.
