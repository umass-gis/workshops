## Meet the instructors

Hi! I'm Dr. Becky Seifried, the Geospatial Information Librarian at UMass Amherst. Before becoming a librarian, I was a research archaeologist who learned how to use GIS out in the field. A lot of my experience with GIS comes from working on projects where I collected geospatial data, georectified historical maps,  interpreted satellite imagery, and more.

Several individuals have contributed to the development of this site, including John Slaff and Amanda Halperin. Shoutout to the Library GIS TAs for their help!

## Have a question about GIS?
Email me at [rseifried@umass.edu](mailto:rseifried@umass.edu) or schedule a [GIS consultation](https://gis.library.umass.edu/learning-gis/get-help/) to meet with me one-on-one.
